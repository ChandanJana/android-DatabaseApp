    1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Introduction</u>
    <br>
    1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Agreement is a legal contract made between the person or entity
    agreeing to these terms and conditions (“you”) and Zebra Technologies Corporation (“Zebra”) that
    governs your use of software, firmware, application programming interfaces, user interfaces, and any
    other type of machine-readable instructions or code as provided by Zebra that accompany or reference
    this Agreement, along with any corresponding documentation (collectively, the “Software”).
    <br><br>
    1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By ordering, subscribing to, installing, executing, or otherwise using
    the Software, you (i) acknowledge that you have read and understand this Agreement, (ii) agree to be

    data are regulated by Zebra’s Privacy Policy in accordance with applicable law.
    <br><br>
    5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zebra is committed to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    compliance and Zebra’s GDPR Addendum (located at: <a

    supplements Zebra’s Privacy Policy.
    <br><br>

    <br>
    6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Content” means image data, images, graphics, text, templates, formats,

    6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge that if the Software requires access to non-Zebra
    hardware, non-Zebra software, or non-Zebra Content to perform a function or provide a feature and
    you deny such permission, the corresponding function or feature will not be available or execute
    properly.
    <br><br>
    6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain functions of the Software may require access to certain software
    and/or hardware. To the extent permission is required, you hereby grant Zebra permission to, during
    the Term, access all software incorporated into Zebra hardware as necessary for the Software to
    perform those functions.
    <br><br>
    6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that any ideas, suggestions, comments, or reviews you provide

    Feedback to improve its products and services.
    <br><br>
    6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where applicable, you agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights”
    or equivalent rights you have in Feedback, Input, or your Content provided to Zebra in connection
    with the Software.
    <br><br>
    7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Updates and Fixes</u>
    <br>
    7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing in this Agreement entitles you to new releases of the Software.
    If Zebra, at its discretion, makes updates, fixes, or patches to the Software available during the
    Term without providing superseding terms, this Agreement applies to such updates, fixes, and
    patches.
    <br><br>
    7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided that the functionality and features of the Software remain
    substantially similar thereafter, Zebra may automatically update the Software without requiring your
    acceptance. Zebra will make reasonable efforts to provide you notice of any automatic updates made
    to the Software, although such notice is not required.

    Software, develop new software or services, understand industry trends, create and publish white
    papers, reports, or databases summarizing the foregoing, investigate and help address and/or prevent
    actual or potential unlawful activity, and generally for any legitimate purpose related to Zebra’s
    business; and

    <br><br>
    10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-party resources linked or made available via the Software are not

    <br><br>
    12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Third Party Claims</u>
    <br>
    In the event of a third-party claim against Zebra alleging that your (i) Content, (ii) Feedback, or
    (iii) Input infringes or misappropriates a third party’s intellectual property rights, you will
    defend and hold Zebra harmless against such a claim, provided Zebra gives you sufficient notice to
    fulfill your obligations of this Section 12 without prejudice due to Zebra’s delay.
    <br><br>
    13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Governing Law</u>
    <br>
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its conflict of
    law provisions. This Agreement shall not be governed by the UN Convention on Contracts for the
    International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. You hereby submit
    yourself and your property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or for
    recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof to the exclusive general jurisdiction
    of the courts of the State of Illinois or to the United States North District Court of Illinois and
    to the respective appellate courts thereof in connection with any appeal therefrom.
    <br><br>
    14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Handling of Disputes</u>
    <br>
    14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge that, in the event you breach any provision of this
    Agreement, Zebra may not have an adequate remedy in money or damages. Zebra shall therefore be
    entitled to seek an injunction against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction
    immediately upon request without posting bond. Zebra's right to seek injunctive relief shall not
    limit its right to seek further remedies.
    <br><br>
    14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any term of this Agreement is to any extent illegal, otherwise
    invalid, or incapable of being enforced, such term shall be excluded to the extent of such
    invalidity or unenforceability, all other terms hereof shall remain in full force and effect, and,
    to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable term shall be deemed replaced by
    a term that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such
    invalid or unenforceable term.
    <br><br>
    14.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge that you and Zebra are the sole parties to this
    Agreement, and you agree to not seek remedies under this Agreement against Zebra’s authorized
    distributors or resellers with respect to the Software.
    <br><br>
    15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Open Source Software</u>
    <br>
    The Software may be subject to one or more open source licenses. The open source license provisions
    may override some terms of this Agreement. Zebra makes the applicable open source licenses available
    on a legal notices readme file and/or in system reference guides or in command line interface (CLI)
    reference guides associated with certain Zebra products.
    <br><br>
    16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>U.S. Government End User Restricted
        Rights</u>
    <br>
    This provision only applies to U.S. Government end users. The Software is a “commercial item” as
    that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Part 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and

    227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, 48 C.F.R. Part 52.227-19, and other relevant sections of the Code of
